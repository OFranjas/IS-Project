# Development Plan

## Server-Side Development:

1. **Model Classes**: Start with the Pet and Owner classes. 
   - Define all the attributes and their getters and setters.
2. **Repositories**: Set up (PetRepository and OwnerRepository).
   - If you're using Spring Data, these might be interfaces extending ReactiveCrudRepository.
3. **Services**: Implement the basic CRUD operations in PetService and OwnerService.
   - Ensure that the service for deleting an owner checks if they have any pets.
4. **Controllers**: Create endpoints for CRUD operations in PetController and OwnerController. 
   - For now, just create the endpoints; you'll handle their logic soon.
5. **Logging**: Integrate logging into your server-side code using LoggerUtil.
   - Ensure meaningful logs are generated for all significant operations.
6. **Test Your Endpoints**: Use tools like Postman or curl to test your CRUD endpoints.

## Client-Side Development:

Great! Given that you've set up the structure, it's essential to approach the development in a systematic way. Here's a recommended order to start developing the files:

1. **WebClientConfig.java**
    - Set up the `WebClient` bean here. This is crucial as the `WebClient` is your main tool for making reactive web requests to the server.
    - Define the base URL for the server (probably in `application.properties` and then reference it here).
    - You can also set up any default headers or filters if necessary.

2. **ClientException.java**
    - It's a good practice to define any custom exceptions early on, so you know what you're working with as you write the services and queries.

3. **OwnerServiceClient.java** and **PetServiceClient.java**
    - Start by defining the reactive methods that fetch data from the server. For instance, methods to get all owners, get a specific owner, get all pets, get a specific pet, etc.
    - Ensure that you handle any exceptions or failed requests gracefully.

4. **NetworkResilienceUtil.java**
    - Given that one of the requirements is to handle network failures, it might be beneficial to have this utility set up early on. Implement the retry logic here.

5. **FileOutputUtil.java**
    - Before moving to queries, set up your utility for writing to files. You'll use this in your queries to save the results.

6. **Query1.java** to **Query9.java**
    - Now, tackle each query one by one.
    - Use the services you've defined to fetch data.
    - Implement any additional operations (filtering, counting, sorting, etc.) as required by the specific query.
    - Save the result to the respective file using the `FileOutputUtil`.

7. **ClientApplication.java**
    - This will be your entry point. Here, run each of the queries. Since no menu or interaction is required, you can simply execute the queries in sequence (or in parallel, if that's beneficial for performance).
    - Ensure you handle any exceptions and provide meaningful logs or outputs, so it's clear what the client is doing.

8. **Test and Refactor**
    - Once all components are developed, test the client against the server. Ensure all queries provide the expected output and handle any edge cases or errors gracefully.
    - If necessary, refactor your code for clarity, performance, or maintainability.

Throughout the development, it's crucial to test each component as you go. For instance, once you've developed the `OwnerServiceClient`, test it to make sure it can fetch the data from the server as expected. This incremental testing will save you time in the long run by ensuring that issues are caught and addressed early in the development process.
