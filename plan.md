# Development Plan

## Server-Side Development:

1. **Model Classes**: Start with the Pet and Owner classes. 
   - Define all the attributes and their getters and setters.
2. **Repositories**: Set up (PetRepository and OwnerRepository).
   - If you're using Spring Data, these might be interfaces extending ReactiveCrudRepository.
3. **Services**: Implement the basic CRUD operations in PetService and OwnerService.
   - Ensure that the service for deleting an owner checks if they have any pets.
4. **Controllers**: Create endpoints for CRUD operations in PetController and OwnerController. 
   - For now, just create the endpoints; you'll handle their logic soon.
5. **Logging**: Integrate logging into your server-side code using LoggerUtil.
   - Ensure meaningful logs are generated for all significant operations.
6. **Test Your Endpoints**: Use tools like Postman or curl to test your CRUD endpoints.

## Client-Side Development:

1. **ServerQueryService**: 
   - Start by implementing the service to fetch names and telephones of all owners. This will give you a feel for how data retrieval from the server will work.
2. **File Writing Utility**: Implement the utility to write the server responses to files (FileUtil).
3. **Implement Queries**:
   - Go in order as specified in the requirements, from the simplest (like fetching names and telephones of all owners) to more complex ones.
   - Ensure that you're using reactive code effectively to handle these queries. Remember, you need to minimize blocking calls and make queries run as quickly as possible.
4. **Network Failures**: Implement the mechanism to retry a connection up to three times in case of network failures
